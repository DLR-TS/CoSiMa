# CoSimulationManager for SETLevel4to5

## Installation Guide

preparations:
install (conan.io)[conan.io] (version 1.29.x or newer )
add conan.exe to PATH environment variable
check out submodules (git submodule update --init --recursive) to get FMI4cpp or use GIT_SUBMODULE CMake option to do so automatically during build
	- FMI4cpp is not available as conan package (might change in the future?)
	- its dependencies are installed using conan, invoked from cmake when building CoSimulationManagerLib

# manual build
in root folder:
```sh
 mkdir build && cd build
 cmake .. # or 'cmake -D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=false ..' on windows, see below
 cmake --build . --target CoSimulationManager 
 cmake --install . # not yet defined
```

 Because of broken dependencies using MSVC, build and use static libraries on windows by appending '-D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=false' to all cmake generation calls

# building in Visual Studio 2017
just open the folder in Visual Studio and use the cmake integration

In Windows in den CMakeSettings.json "cmakeCommandArgs": "-D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=false", einf√ºgen.
Do not build the libs shared.

use cmake for project generation

# CMake FetchContent Overrides
Some dependencies are retrieved using CMake's FetchContent Module. To override their source in your local repository, create a file named 'CMake_FetchContent_Overrides.cmake' and use the FetchContent_declare() to declare your desired replacement. The will be included by the root CmakeLists.txt file. CMake_FetchContent_Overrides.cmake is ignored and thus will not be added to the global repository. 

LibCarla_client, its dependencies and gRPC currently are included using FetchContent.
